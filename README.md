# Virtual-Art-Gallery

### Description 
Welcome to the Virtual Art Gallery, where artists can create exhibitions to showcase their work so that we can all connect with the enriching power of art. We invite you to look around and explore what the virtual gallery has to offer, engage with artists by liking, sharing and commenting on their exhibitions.

### How to use
Broadly, you can use this application in two roles:
1. Artists are registered users who have exhibition creation privileges and can add their art pieces to showcase their work.
2. Viewers can visit artist profiles and their exhibitions by clicking through the artist's name as well as show their appreciation by leaving comments and likes.
